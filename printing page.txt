* two css styles, one for screen and one for print

1) make controls/gridview from css
2) create print css with white very basic formatting
3) header link ="styles.css", media="screen"
4) header link ="printstyles.css" media="print"
5) suppress elements you don't want printed - in css: find "id" in html source, in css set that class to #class visibilty:hidden; height: 0px; width: 0px;

web api

install from nuget

install as project web api

modify web.config to change'routing'

great for non-soap services

supposedly better than wcf.   it's new.

makes everyting extensible.  replace almost everything.

map uris and verbs to controller

first developed at codeplex.

use http protocol

WCF remains the framework for building services where you care about transport flexibility. WebAPI is the framework for building services where you care about HTTP.

define 'end points'.  also needed for wcf.

The WCF Web API abstractions map to ASP.NET Web API roughly as follows

WCF Web AP -> ASP.NET Web API
Service -> Web API controller
Operation -> Action
Service contract -> Not applicable
Endpoint -> Not applicable
URI templates -> ASP.NET Routing
Message handlers -> Same
Formatters -> Same
Operation handlers -> Filters, model binders
and http://wcf.codeplex.com/discussions/319671

The integrated stack supports the following features:

Modern HTTP programming model
Full support for ASP.NET Routing
Content negotiation and custom formatters
Model binding and validation
Filters
Query composition
Easy to unit test
Improved Inversion of Control (IoC) via DependencyResolver
Code-based configuration
Self-host

usually paramters just pass copy.  can't change value

parameter keywords:

ref and out keywords allow pass 'by reference'
ref paramaters req. initialied variable

public bool work (ref string text, out int age)
{

  return int32.tryparse(text, out age);

}

ref = you will use this variable

out = ou don't have to use, so doesn't haver to initialized

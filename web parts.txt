great for PORTALS  (need authentication first)

each "section" ofa  web portal is a web part.  other stuff is "chrome" around it.

all kinds of cool features (close web part, resize, remember, toolbar options, etc.)

began as a 'web control' in sharepoint.  extending sharepoint.

entire section of toolbox filled with webpart controls.  used to create your own portal.

view modes: browse, edit, design, etc. (links in toolbar)

set authentication mode to windows.  so everyone is authenticated right from the bat.
